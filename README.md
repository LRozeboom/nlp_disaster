# nlp_disaster

This is my first project on natural language processing using Tensorflow.
Datasets from kaggle project: 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets'
Trying to predict wether tweets are about a disaster or not.
Model uses Glove pretrained embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and a bidirectional LSTM layout for making predictions.
Accuracy of ~0.80 achieved as of 4 feb 2022.
